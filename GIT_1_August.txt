1) We modified our file
2) We staged and committed the updated file.
3) Now, we want to remove our changes and want to restore our file to previous level.
  Ans:- 
   Step1:- we will first check for the log in which we made the changes 
                git log
   Step2:- Get the first 5 digits of latest commit id that we get in above step, and type below command to know what was the thing modified in recent commit by us.
	git show 81a00
  Step3:- Revert our changes in the recent commit by using below command
                git revert 81a00
          Now, to revert the revert, that is we again want to bring back our changes we did before starting this process (i.e. we want to bring our file back to condition in which it was at step1)
    Step4:-  git log
                      This will give us the commit id that we get in step 3 (Eg:- 21a9802850483939)
               Take the first 5 digits of the commit id that we get in above step and then revert this commit id.
               git revert 21a980
     NOTe:-  ALL AOVE STEPS WILL SHOW AS MULTIPLE COMMITS WHEN WE CHECK IN LOGS. HENCE, SUPPOSE IN ORDER WE WANT TO NOT SHOW ALL THESE LOGS AND WANT OUR FILES TO BE RESTORED TO A PARTICULAR COMMIT ID THEN WE CAN OVER-RIDE ALL ABOVE LOGS BY REVERTING OUR CHANGES TO A PARTICULAR COMMIT ID THAT GOT GENERATED IN ABOVE STEPS, USING BELOW COMMAND
                git reset --hard  81a00
